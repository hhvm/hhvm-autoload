Autoload Map Generator for HHVM
===============================

Warning
-------

This branch is a work in progress at a pure userspace map generator. If
you're looking for the HHVM 2.0 extension, it's in the `legacy-hhvm-2`
branch (and you really should upgrade to a version of HHVM that's
supported and receiving security updates).

In the mean time, use Composer, and use the `autoload/files` configuration
to load things that aren't classes.
